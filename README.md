# List Manager

## What is List Manager?

A CLI application with a UI for editing lists.

## Why List Manager?

List Manager has a very easy UI to use, even though it is based on CLI.

And it does not have forced choosable "circles" or "squares" for list items (checkboxes).

## What can I do with List Manager?

In the latest version, you can add or delete an item from a list; you can view, clear, sort, or export a list; you can create a new list and see all created lists.

You can also switch to Debug Mode with the `mode` command, set a wait time for commands, watch your system's performance, and test all commands.

You can restart List Manager and see the full command history in each mode... and yes, there is already a command to exit List Manager...

## Who is List Manager for?

People who prefer simple, fast, and keyboard-driven tools over graphical interfaces.

## What I can't do with List Manager?

Dangerous things.  


And lists with forced choosable "circles" or "squares" (checkboxes).
